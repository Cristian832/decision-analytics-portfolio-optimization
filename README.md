Project Overview

This project analyzes Lending Club loan data to support an investment decision under a fixed capital constraint.

An investment firm plans to allocate up to $10M and requires:

Default risk estimation

Expected loss and return quantification

A transparent, risk-controlled portfolio construction framework

The analysis moves from data preparation → predictive modeling → economic decision-making.

Business Objective

Identify which loans are most suitable for investment by predicting default risk and estimating expected losses and returns, in order to build a portfolio that maximizes expected return while controlling risk.
